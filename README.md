## A Little About Me
Hello! My name is Lyra, and I am growing myself in the environmental and geospatial world. I am a recent graduate from Montana State University with a degree in Environmental Science with an emphasis in Soil and Water Science. I have four years of GIS and data analysis experience along with a cumulative of two years of coding experience in R and Python. Welcome to my GitHub portfolio, it's nice to have you here :)
